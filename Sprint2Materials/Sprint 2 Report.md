# Sprint 2 Report (10/10/2022 - 11/9/2022)

## What's New
 * Testing and Acceptance Plans section of project documentation added
 * No new transformative user-facing features at this time

## Work Summary
For Sprint 2, our main efforts were generally focused around administrative tasks and gaining a greater understanding of the StochPy codebase we will be working with for the next several months. By nature of our project being centered around working around a preexisting research codebase, we have spent most of our development time gaining background knowledge on stochastic simulations, understanding academic papers and other sources provided by our sponsor Dr. Lofgren, reading the documentation of StochPy and other libraries to gain additional background knowledge, and so on. Additionally, we have made sure to keep our github repository up to date with our progress.

## Unfinished Work
All issues designated for Sprint 2 have been completed. However, in terms of the overall work needed for this project, we still need to work towards implementing the actual stochastic simulation functions, though we are formulating a rigorous plan for this. 

## Completed Issues
The vast majority of issues completed were administrative in nature, largely involving uploading documentation and other background materials. As such, we felt that including before-and-after videos for these issues would be redundant, as the changes are self-evident by nature of new files being added to the repository. We plan on creating such videos for significant feature additions, such as comparing before-and-after runtimes for comparing stochastic simulation performance. 

Still, here are links to the issues that we completed in this sprint:

 ## Incomplete Issues
There were no issues assigned to this sprint that remain incomplete. 

## Code Files for Review
The only notable work involving code is most easily reviewable by examining the merge at which the work was incorporated to change a small element of the StochPy sourcecode to stop a welcome banner from being displayed.

## Retrospective Summary
Here's what went well:
  * Acquiring background information and developing a basic understanding of the StochPy/stochastic simulation subject matter
  * Collaborating with each other in a constructive and productive manner
  * Generally meeting deadlines and adapting our targeted backend-focused project to the supplied full-stack-esque templates
 
Here's what we'd like to improve:
   * Planning the timeframe of future activities, delineating these activities to begin with, 
   * Frequency of communication with Dr. Lofgren
  
Here are changes we plan to implement in the next sprint:
   * Emphasis on planning ahead and accurately calculating time needed to complete certain tasks by making extensive use of the GitHub project board, team communication, and the issues system
   * Ensuring that regular communications are maintained with Dr. Lofgren through frequent emails apprising him of our status and asking questions, as needed
