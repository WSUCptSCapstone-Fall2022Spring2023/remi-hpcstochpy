# Sprint 2 Report (10/10/2022 - 11/9/2022)

## What's New
 * Testing and Acceptance Plans section of project documentation added
 * Welcome message removed from StochPy (FR II.2.3)
 * No new significantly transformative user-facing features at this time

## Work Summary
For Sprint 2, our main efforts were generally focused around administrative tasks and gaining a greater understanding of the StochPy codebase we will be working with for the next several months. By nature of our project being centered around working around a preexisting research codebase, we have spent most of our development time gaining background knowledge on stochastic simulations, understanding academic papers and other sources provided by our sponsor Dr. Lofgren, reading the documentation of StochPy and other libraries to gain additional background knowledge, and so on. Additionally, we have made sure to keep our GitHub repository up to date with our progress and have made minor changes to the code. We have also planned out our approach to parallelizing the StochPy's stochastic simulation function, though actual implementation is still in the works. 

## Unfinished Work
All issues designated for Sprint 2 have been completed. However, in terms of the overall work needed for this project, we still need to work towards implementing the actual stochastic simulation functions, though we have formulated a plan to parallelize this. 

## Completed Issues
The majority of issues completed were administrative in nature, largely involving uploading documentation and other background materials, along with one minor coding task. 

Still, here are links to the issues that we completed in this sprint:

* [Update Sprint 2 documentation](https://github.com/WSUCptSCapstone-Fall2022Spring2023/remi-hpcstochpy/issues/37)

 ## Incomplete Issues
There were no issues assigned to this sprint that remain incomplete. 

## Code Files for Review
The only notable work involving code is most easily reviewable by examining the merge at which the work was incorporated to change a small element of the StochPy source code to stop a welcome banner from being displayed.

## Retrospective Summary
Here's what went well:
  * Acquiring background information and continuing to develop an understanding of the StochPy/stochastic simulation subject matter
  * Collaborating with each other in a constructive and productive manner
 
Here's what we'd like to improve:
   * Planning the timeframe of future activities and delineating these activities to begin with
   * Increasing feature implementation speed
  
Here are changes we plan to implement in the next sprint:
   * Emphasis on planning ahead and accurately calculating time needed to complete certain tasks by making extensive use of the GitHub project board, team communication, and the issues system
   * Ramping up implementation of features by conducting extensive planning, researching documentation, and obtaining script files
