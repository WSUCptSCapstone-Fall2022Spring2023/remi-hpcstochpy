No significant changes have been made in regards to the project which necessitate another video.
Documentation has been added to and updated in the repo as needed and the only code implemented is easy to examine from the merge it was commited in.
As such there is no new video as the video for sprint 1 sufficiently covers any major elements of our progress thus far.

This video can be found at: https://youtu.be/_M0LS0O733w

The video should be unlisted, have a title of "Sprint 1 Video", and be uploaded to the account "Ryan Charit". Thank you!
