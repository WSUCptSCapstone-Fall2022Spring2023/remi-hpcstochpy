Defaults to not using seed, could be removed?
does a bunch of annoying nonsense with the directory it is working in, this is cause of location issue
Allows user to set model file and directory to output, is used by client
Allows user to set endtime, used by client
allows user to change parameters, used by client
many unused elements

DoStochSim : 653 of StochSim
many many checks on traits not used
saves data and datagrid at 706/707
	need SSA.parse : 33 in StochPyTools
	need SSASettings : 45
	need SSA.execute : 56 in DirectMethod
	need FillDataStochSim : 1892
	need Analysis.DoPlotting : 409 in Analysis
Calls to other things which do the actual simulation

GetRegularGrid : 1083 of StochSim
	need IntigrationStochasticDataObject from PyscesMiniModel
	needs np.linspace
complex and messy array manupulation to provide output

Model : 309 of StochSim
sets the file and output directory for the SSA model

Endtime : 261 of StochSim
sets end time for SSA model and swaps mode to time rather than steps

ChangeParameter : 386 of StochSim
sets specified parameter to specified value

SSASettings : 45 of StochSim
holds setting information

Execute : 56 of DirectMethod
does a lot of messy setup work
calls the simulation for the step
does messy output work
repeats in loop for whole simulation
	needs RunExactTimestep : 131

RunExactTimestep : 131 of DirectMethod
runs a simulation step, very messy, more complex than is needed for redo
	needs several sim...etc elements from StochPyTools

Parse : 33 in StochPyTools
	needs PySCeS_Connector from PyscesMiniModel
does more annoying name and directory changes
uses a lot of Numba incompatible operations with no easy replacement

Pycses parser full of Numba incompatability, reformatting input seems inevitable.
