# Sprint 7 Report (4/3/2023 - 5/2/2023)

## What's New
 * Developed Numba compatible stochastic simulation implementation for poster presentation
 * Confirmed potential for further development in Python if desired
 * Investigated potential alternatives and necessary accommodations in Julia
 * Prepared and presented poster on project
 * Touched base with Dr. Lofgren about moving to Julia
 * Finalized MVP Report

## Work Summary
For Sprint 7, we succesfully developed a prototype to demonstrate the benefits of Numba and Dask for use with Stochastic Simulations in Python. We prepared a poster presentation to display and explain the benefits of and research behind this prototype and gave our conclusions on the viability of replacing StochPy with a more modern implementation of the library making use of these modern tools. We also investigated potentially shifting the language of future tools for the client to Julia, looking into replacements for StochPy as well as the necessary tools to accommodate such a shift.

## Unfinished Work
While no work remains unfinished in terms of out goals and objectives, there is much room for further development and improvement upon the existing research and prototype should the client choose to continue investigating optimization of their stochastim simulation techniques.

## Retrospective Summary
Here's what went well:
  * Acquiring a better understanding of the technologies we are using (Dask, Numba, Julia)
  * Acquiring a better understanding of StochPy and stochastic simulation as a whole
  * Communicating our work and efforts to our client
 
Here's what we'd like to improve:
   * Accelerate implementation speed
   * Improve quality and production rate of deliverables in a satisfactory timeframe
  
Here are changes we plan to implement in the next sprint:
   * Ramping up implementation speed by enforcing stricter self-defined deadlines for Sprint issues
   * Dedicate more time and attention to working on deliverables, along with working with the team for them
