Given list of reactions with probabilities calculated from density values
Calculate how long you wait for a thing to happen
Determine which thing happened
update the timestamp UNEVEN TIMESTAMP SPACINGS
update values
repeat cycle

Example:
Species X
Growth rate of X = 6
Decay rate of X = 0.3*X

Event: X + 1 
Rate: 6
Event: X - 1 
Rate: 0.3X

Take sum of rates

tau = random selection from exponential distribution of 1/sum of rates

at tau, select event from list randomly based on probabilities
run the event

repeat loop until tau >= endtime
